			<p>You can't fight the rain nor can you stop the rain,but you can certainly dance in it. When life brings the rain, bring the dance. If there's one thing I've learned in all my years of dancing, it's that life's lessons are hidden within. It's not only about learning how to dance, but learning how to live. </p>

			<p><string style="font-family:forte;font-size:18px">Lead. </string> Learning how to lead is the hardest aspect to grasp when learning how to dance.. It is the physical creation and representation of emotion inside. It's also one of the scariest parts, because it's pure vulnerability. Learning to drop walls that have been built up throughout life is what makes it the hardest part of learning to dance, but this also is one of the most rewarding experiences in life. When there are no walls and only being, art can begin. Sadly enough, people usually only experience this when they're older and realize it's those walls that have kept them from living. Walls are built for protection, and they are also built for prisons. Seldom do we realize the walls we build for ourselves are more prisons than protection. A leader cannot lead behind walls.</p>

			<p><string style="font-family:forte;font-size:18px">Follow. </string> Eventually, learning how to follow becomes the harder part of dancing, and coincidentally , the hardest part of life. When a leader learns how to lead, the lead is theirs no matter who they are dancing with. However, with following, you will always be adjusting to each leader you dance with, because everyone's lead is different. Following can teach one of the most fundamental lessons: control is only an illusion. When life throws curveballs and people feel lost is when one tries so hard to grasp for more control, which in turn creates a bigger mess. What people don't understand is the more lost you feel, the more you surrender. Only then, do you feel where you're being lead.</p>

			<p><string style="font-family:forte;font-size:18px">Move. </string> Life leads - Music guides - Experiences teach. You are an instrument for them all. Move! Go with the flow, and go with your instinct. As both leader and follower, when you second guess yourself, you will usually guess wrong. Your instinct and gut will tell you what's right. Move with it. When your brain turns on, it will interfere with what you instinctively felt was right the first time. Don't look where you're going, <i>feel</i> where you're going. You know the right path, it's your job to move down it, and when you feel the rain - <b>DANCE!</b></p>
